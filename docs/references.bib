  abstract  = {We study the question of feature sets for robust visual object recognition; adopting linear SVM based human detection as a test case. After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

@inproceedings{porikli2005,
  abstract  = {We present a novel method, which we refer as an integral histogram, to compute the histograms of all possible target regions in a Cartesian data space. Our method has three distinct advantages: 1) It is computationally superior to the conventional approach. The integral histogram method makes it possible to employ even an exhaustive search process in real-time, which was impractical before. 2) It can be extended to higher data dimensions, uniform and nonuniform bin formations, and multiple target scales without sacrificing its computational advantages. 3) It enables the description of higher level histogram features. We exploit the spatial arrangement of data points, and recursively propagate an aggregated histogram by starting from the origin and traversing through the remaining points along either a scan-line or a wave-front. At each step, we update a single bin using the values of integral histogram at the previously visited neighboring data points. After the integral histogram is propagated, histogram of any target region can be computed easily by using simple arithmetic operations.},
