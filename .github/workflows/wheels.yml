      # As for Pillow 11.0.0, there is no aarch64 wheel for the
      # free-threaded variant of Python 3.13 (both many* and musl*). We
      # therefore skip the tests to avoid compiling Pillow from source which
      # generally will fail due to missing dependencies.

      # Additonally, there is no PyPy 3.9 aarch64 wheel of NumPy which is then
      # built from source but fails with enabled LTO. Also PyPy 3.9 macOS 15

      # Finally, there are no PyPy 3.11 wheels of Pillow. Skip until these are
      # provided.
